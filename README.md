# Timeseries Replay

Streaming Data frequently crosses different systems, frameworks and applications.
This makes it really hard to architect for and test.

Generating fake data to load test often fails to replicate real life scenarios.
Sometimes it maybe useful to take an existing events table with timestamps and replay those at the same rate (or perhaps sped up rate)

this application will hopefully be able to do some of that
