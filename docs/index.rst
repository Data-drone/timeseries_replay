Welcome to Timeseries Replay's documentation!
=============================================

Timeseries Replay is designed to help restream data logged into a database at the same rate as it was originally stored.
This helps faciliate load testing and can help with analysing latencies in systems as well.
It is designed to accept any *SQLAlchemy* compatible datasource and at the moment supports writing out data either as separate files or into a Kafka topic.
